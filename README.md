This project focuses on web accessibilty, and cross browser testing and following a design layout.


The problem
I started by creating the site mobile first according to the given design layout. Then when I was almost finished with the mobile version I did the tablet and the desktop version. HTML & CSS was used for structuring and styling. After I was almost finished with the layout I checked the responsiveness and made the site more accessible by making it usable for keyboard. Then I added aria attributes to elements that needed them. I checked the accessibility level by using Lighthouse in dev tools in Chrome. I used the Chromevox screenreader to check how to site works with screenreader. I tested the function of the site in Edge, Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Also tried on iPhone X on Chrome and Safari.
